## About This Project

This repository is part of my professional portfolio. It is a work in progress that I am making public to demonstrate:
- My coding style and project structure
- The full data science workflow (data processing, EDA, feature engineering, modeling)
- My ability to manage larger projects with modular code
- My technical skills across a variety of tools including SQL, Python, and Excel.

⚠️ Note: Because this is ongoing, not all functionality is complete. The repository will be updated as the project develops.
